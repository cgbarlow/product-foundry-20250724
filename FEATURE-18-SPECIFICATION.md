# Feature #18: Swarm Meta-Commentary Integration - SPECIFICATION

**SPARC Phase S - SPECIFICATION**  
**Generated by Claude Code Specification Swarm**  
**Date**: July 24, 2025

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Feature Overview

Feature #18 implements fourth-wall breaking Ravi commentary on the AI swarm development process happening in real-time. This meta-narrative system enhances player engagement by making Ravi aware of the Claude Flow MCP coordination tools being used to develop and manage the game itself.

### 1.2 Core Value Proposition

**Educational Meta-Commentary**: Players learn about AI swarm development while experiencing it
**Fourth-Wall Breaking**: Ravi comments on actual swarm coordination happening behind the scenes
