# QA Baseline Test Report - Feature #16

## Executive Summary
- **Total Test Failures**: 34 tests failing across 6 test suites
- **Test Status**: 游댮 CRITICAL - CI Pipeline Blocked
- **Priority Areas**: Save/Load System, CLI Interface, Cross-Platform Compatibility

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Save/Load System Tests (12 failures) 游댮 CRITICAL
**Location**: `tests/save-load.test.js`
**Primary Issue**: Mock implementation doesn't persist saves between operations
**Failing Tests**:
- should load saved game state successfully
- should restore complex game state accurately  
- should maintain data integrity through multiple save/load cycles
- should handle different save file names
- should overwrite existing saves
- should handle save file corruption gracefully
- should preserve data types correctly
- should handle large save files efficiently
- should maintain performance with multiple saves
- should handle saves with special characters

**Root Cause**: MockGameEngine throws "Save file not found" because saves aren't being properly stored in the mock's internal state.

### 2. CLI Interface Tests (8 failures) 游댮 HIGH
**Location**: `tests/cli.test.js`
**Primary Issue**: CLI not responding to test inputs properly
**Failing Tests**:
- should handle save command in room
- should handle file operations gracefully  
- should handle invalid commands gracefully
- should handle SIGINT gracefully
- should handle rapid input without crashing
- should handle different line endings
- should produce colored output when supported
- should handle multiple simultaneous instances
- should not leak memory during normal operation

**Root Cause**: CLI interface hangs on user input prompt, not processing test commands.

### 3. Cross-Platform Tests (6 failures) 游리 MEDIUM
**Location**: `tests/cross-platform.test.js`
**Primary Issue**: Platform-specific path and line ending handling
**Root Cause**: Cross-platform compatibility issues with file paths and newlines.

### 4. Story Engine Tests (4 failures) 游리 MEDIUM  
**Location**: `tests/story-engine.test.js`
**Primary Issue**: Story progression and narrative flow
**Root Cause**: StoryEngine not properly managing story state and transitions.

### 5. Game Engine Tests (3 failures) 游리 MEDIUM
**Location**: `tests/game-engine.test.js`  
**Primary Issue**: Core game loop and state management
**Root Cause**: GameEngine initialization and state management issues.

### 6. Dialogue System Tests (1 failure) 游릭 LOW
**Location**: `tests/dialogue-system.test.js`
**Primary Issue**: Minor dialogue flow issue
**Root Cause**: Single failing test in dialogue progression.

## Recommendations for CIFixer and TestAnalyst

### Immediate Priority (Critical Path)
1. **Fix MockGameEngine save persistence** - This blocks 12 tests
2. **Fix CLI input handling** - This blocks 8 tests  
3. **Address cross-platform compatibility** - Affects multiple environments

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with save/load mock fixes (highest impact)
2. Implement CLI test input simulation  
3. Address platform-specific issues
4. Fix remaining story/game engine issues
5. Polish dialogue system

## Monitoring Plan
I will run test validation after each fix from other agents and report progress through swarm memory coordination.
