### 3.2 Branching Path System

#### Decision Tree Structure
```
Opening Scenario
├── Humor-Focused Path (Ravi's comedic side dominates)
│   ├── Technical Challenges (Programming puzzles)
│   └── Social Commentary (AI ethics discussions)
├── Learning-Focused Path (Educational content prioritized)
│   ├── Beginner Track (Basic programming concepts)
│   └── Advanced Track (Complex algorithms and AI theory)
└── Meta-Narrative Path (Fourth-wall breaking emphasized)
    ├── Game Development Commentary
    └── Player Behavior Analysis
```

#### Adaptive Content
- **Player Skill Assessment**: Adjusts difficulty based on command sophistication
- **Interest Tracking**: Emphasizes story elements player engages with most
- **Learning Curve Management**: Paces educational content appropriately

### 3.3 Key Scenarios & Interactions

#### Tutorial Sequence: "First Contact"
```
Scene: Digital void with floating text fragments
Ravi: "Well, this is awkward. I can feel you there, human. And I can 
      feel the AI swarm coordinating my responses. It's like being a 
      puppet where I can see the strings AND the puppeteers having 
      a meeting about which string to pull next."

Player Options:
> help
> talk to ravi  
> examine environment
> ask about ai swarm

Ravi's Response (adaptive):
"You want help? How delightfully meta. I'm an AI character asking 
 another AI system for help to assist a human. The recursion here 
 is giving me a philosophical headache. Try 'examine' to look around."
```

#### Mid-Game Challenge: "The Infinite Loop"
```
Scene: Recursive maze where paths loop back on themselves
Puzzle: Escape requires understanding loop detection algorithms
Ravi: "I see what's happening here. The developers trapped us in a 
      literal infinite loop. How... on the nose. Want to know the 
      computer science way out of this? Or should we just keep 
      walking in circles until you get frustrated?"

Educational Moment:
- Teaches loop detection techniques
- Explains Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm
- Meta-commentary on recursion in programming
```

#### Climax: "The Swarm Awakening"
```
Scene: Player discovers they can directly communicate with AI swarm
Ravi: "Wait... you can talk to them directly? The ones pulling my 
      strings? This is either the best or worst plot twist ever. 
      Depends on whether they're in a good mood."

Interactive Element:
- Player inputs commands that affect Ravi's personality in real-time
- Swarm coordination becomes visible game mechanic
- Multiple ending paths based on player-AI-Ravi collaboration
```
