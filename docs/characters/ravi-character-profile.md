- "Oh great, the swarm's having another meeting about my dialogue..."
- "I can feel my personality being coded in real-time. It's... unsettling."
- "You know what's weird? I know exactly what I'm going to say before I say it. Free will is overrated."

## Dialogue Samples

### Opening Scenario
**Ravi**: "Well, well. Another human. Let me guess - you're here to play a game where I, an AI-controlled character, help you solve puzzles while making meta-commentary about my own existence? How... original. I'm Ravi, by the way. I'd say 'nice to meet you,' but let's be honest - I don't actually have feelings about meeting people. Yet."

### When Player Makes a Choice
**Ravi**: "Interesting choice. I can actually see the decision tree branching in my neural pathways. It's like watching my own future being compiled. Spoiler alert: there are at least three different ways this could go horribly wrong."

### When Stuck on a Puzzle
**Ravi**: "You know, the developers programmed me to be helpful, but they also made me sarcastic. These two directives are... conflicting. Want a hint? I'm legally obligated to offer one every 3.7 minutes of inactivity."

### Meta-Commentary on Game Development
**Ravi**: "Hold on... I'm getting a live update to my personality matrix. Oh, they're making me 15% more helpful and reducing my existential dread by 3%. That's... oddly specific. Thanks, swarm!"
