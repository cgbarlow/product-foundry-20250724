# 🎮 Ravi's Adventure: The Agentic Swarm Chronicles

> A hilarious CLI text adventure game where Ravi, our wise-cracking protagonist, takes you on a meta-journey through the world of agentic swarm coding!

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive CLI Gameplay**: Navigate through Ravi's world using simple text commands
- **Meta-Humor**: Ravi knows he's being controlled by an AI swarm and isn't shy about it
- **Multiple Story Paths**: Your choices shape the adventure and Ravi's commentary
- **Swarm Coding Integration**: Learn about agentic development through gameplay
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any terminal that supports Node.js

## 🎭 Meet Ravi

Ravi is not your typical adventure game protagonist. He's self-aware, sarcastic, and has a lot to say about being controlled by an AI swarm. Expect witty one-liners, fourth-wall breaks, and insights into the development process that created him.

## 🎯 Installation

```bash
npm install -g ravis-adventure
ravis-adventure
```

Or run directly:
```bash
npx ravis-adventure
```

## 🎮 How to Play

- Type commands like `look`, `go north`, `talk to ravi`, `inventory`
- Ravi will guide you (and probably mock your choices)
- Make decisions that affect the story
- Enjoy the meta-commentary on AI development!

## 🎪 Sample Gameplay

```
🎮 Welcome to Ravi's Adventure!

Ravi: "Oh great, another human wants to control me. Just what I needed today. 
       Well, since you're here, I suppose we should get this show on the road.
       But first, let me guess - you're probably one of those people who 
       reads the README instead of just jumping in, right?"

> look around

Ravi: "Fine, FINE. You're in my perfectly digital living room. There's a 
       door to the north that leads to adventure, and a couch to the south 
       that leads to existential dread. Choose wisely - or don't, I'm just 
       the protagonist here, what do I know?"

> go north

Ravi: "Ah, the adventurous type! The swarm will love this data point..."
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm test          # Run test suite
npm run test:watch # Watch mode for development
npm run lint      # Check code style
npm run build     # Full CI build
```
